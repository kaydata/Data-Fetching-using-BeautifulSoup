# Data-Fetching-using-BeautifulSoup
This tutorial outlines a Python-based project aimed at importing petroleum price data from the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) website. Initially, it guides through a basic data retrieval using the requests library, followed by an introduction to HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup to make the data readable and organized. The tutorial further delves into a more advanced data fetching script that not only locates and downloads CSV and Excel files from the webpage but also saves them to the disk. Through a step-by-step approach, it demonstrates how to utilize libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas to automate the process of data retrieval, parsing, and initial analysis.
